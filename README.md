# Student Result Management System (SQL Project)

## About the Project
This project is a Student Result Management System created using SQL.  
The purpose of this project is to manage student details and their exam results in a structured database and to retrieve useful information using SQL queries.

This project helped me understand how student records and results can be stored, updated, and analyzed using a relational database.

## Problem Statement
Managing student results manually can lead to errors, data duplication, and difficulty in retrieving records.  
Educational institutions need a proper system to store student information and exam results in an organized manner.

This project solves the problem by using SQL to store student data and generate result-related information efficiently.

## What This Project Does
- Stores student details and subject-wise marks
- Maintains exam and result records
- Calculates total marks and performance-related data
- Retrieves student results using SQL queries
- Helps understand basic result analysis using a database

---

## Technologies Used
- SQL (MySQL)
- MySQL Workbench

---

## Database Overview
The database contains tables such as:
- `students` – stores student personal details
- `subjects` – stores subject information
- `results` – stores marks and exam results

These tables are connected using primary and foreign keys to maintain consistency and avoid redundant data.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open MySQL Workbench
2. Create a new database
3. Import the file `student result management system.sql`
4. Execute the SQL script
5. Run the queries to view and analyze student results

---

## Sample Queries and Analysis
- Display all student results
- Find total and average marks
- Identify pass and fail students
- Subject-wise performance analysis
- Retrieve result of a specific student

## What I Learned
- Designing relational databases
- Writing SQL queries with JOINs and aggregate functions
- Handling student and result data using SQL
- Understanding how result management systems work in real life
